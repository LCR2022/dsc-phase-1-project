![download](https://github.com/LCR2022/dsc-phase-1-project/assets/99391873/17753733-f5f2-4cff-b67b-f91b8cb10818)
## Overview
This project explores the types of films that are currently doing well at the box office and  the needs of the [Microsoft Corporation](https://www.microsoft.com/) which wants to set up a new movie studio. The Microsoft corporation can use these insights to decide what type of films to create.

## Business Problem
Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

## Data
This project utilized datasets from the following movie sites:
* [IMDBLinks](https://www.imdb.com/)
This site provides the different genres of movies.
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)
This site provided the budgets that went into the production of different movies and the profits realized(both locally and overseas). From the data, the Return on Investment was computed.

## Methods
This project utilizes descriptive analysis, including a description of trends over time.

## Results
### 1. Movie Production is declining
From 2019, the number of movies produced peaked in 2018 and in 2019, started to decline coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic. The industry is yet to pick up the production rate which appears to have leveled off.

### 2. Drama is the most lucrative Movie Genre.
The top 2 movies genres produced in the industry are:
* Drama and Documentary

### 3. Friday is the best day to release a movie

Companies that release movies on Friday Made the highest Return on Investment by a huge margin. The worst days to release a movie would be Saturday through Monday.

## Conclusion
This analysis leads to three recommendations that Microsoft Corporation can take into account before deciding on what movies to make:

* Focus on producing either of the top 2 genres: Drama and Documentary which also have the highest Return on Investment
* Release any movies it intends to produce on a Friday to realize the highest Return on Investment.

## Next steps
Further analyses could yield additional insights to further improve operations at AAC:

* **Incorporate datasets movie ratings indicating User-Id.** This dataset will weed out more than one rating from a person and give a clear picture of the market preference.
